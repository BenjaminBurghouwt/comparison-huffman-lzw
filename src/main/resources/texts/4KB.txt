At the edge of the village, where fields met the dark line of the forest, the annual Harvest Festival was underway. Tables groaned under bowls piled with dark berries, platters of roast meat, and trays of soft bread brushed with honey and herbs. Beneath the twilight sky, villagers danced in rings, their feet kicking up dust that mingled with drifting lantern light. Children ran between the tables, faces sticky with fruit, laughing as they wove between the adults.
Elena stood at the center of it all, garlanded in ivy and small, deep-hued flowers. She wore a long, russet gown threaded with green ribbons and trimmed in shades of harvest-colors woven to fade softly into the deep colors of the evening. She held her head high, her hands clasped lightly before her as she watched the dancers swirl around her. Some paused to pass her handfuls of petals, others touched her shoulders or arms briefly before moving on, adding touches to her ensemble-a dusting of soil on her hands, a necklace of braided wheat, and sprigs of lavender tucked in her hair.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the village elder, draped in darkened reeds and carrying a heavy staff, called for silence. The music quieted, and the villagers turned toward the elder and Elena, gathering in a circle. One of the children, a boy no more than five, wandered up to Elena and handed her a roughly made toy carved from dark wood-a round, hollow figure, wrapped with the thick cords of some vine. She took it, nodding solemnly, and the crowd murmured their approval.
With the elder's nod, the feast began again, and Elena moved through the tables, exchanging greetings with each villager. She passed a table where an old woman, busy weaving with dried corn husks, looked up to hand her a small woven crown that seemed almost brittle to the touch. Elena slipped it on her head, moving with the others through the firelight. At one point, a group of young men led her to an open area near the edge of the fields, where she sat as they washed her feet in large, carved basins filled with water darkened by herbs. They took the water afterward, sprinkling it over the crops nearby with reverence.
At last, the dancing resumed, faster and louder than before, and Elena joined in, her movements slow and graceful. As she spun in her gown, the harvest colors of the fabric blurred, giving her a look of being rooted, as if she'd grown up from the very soil beneath her.
When the night reached its height, she stepped away from the firelight, toward the edge of the forest, her gown sweeping over the earth. Villagers lined the path she took, and some reached out, brushing her fingers or offering garlands of vines. She wore them without comment, her silhouette slowly melting into the shadows of the trees as she stepped deeper into the forest. Behind her, the villagers murmured among themselves before returning to the fire, their conversations and laughter carrying through the night. No one followed her.
As dawn broke, Elena's absence went unnoticed, replaced by the clamor of new activity. The villagers rose with the sunrise, preparing their tools and working in the fields with renewed energy. Fruits seemed riper, the crops more abundant, and the livestock unusually robust. The children who wandered the fields in play grew more energetic, their voices louder, echoing through the trees. Some had a faint, unfamiliar hue to their skin, a color that seemed to catch the morning light in ways that were striking, if unremarked upon. One child stumbled upon a single, dark braid on the edge of the field, woven with bright green leaves. He twirled it through his fingers before tucking it behind his ear, his family merely smiling as he did so.
